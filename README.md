# Transfering-Planswift-to-excel-format
Converts Mechanical take-off csv into company specific excel format

If you use planswift you most likely have a different format for both your take-off tools and your excels, so this program wont work BUT call me up and i can make a custom one for you

I hope this program helps other estimators out in the wild
